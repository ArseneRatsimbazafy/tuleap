Pain point
==========

2020-03-05 - team retro to speak about how painfull it is for team to work in 2 separate repositories.
Identified pain point:

  - double patches to made and review
  - time to provide a patch is explode
  - we can't bisect code
  - we have two specific CI setup, have them coherent is painfull
  - we are not able to provide e2e tests in this context
